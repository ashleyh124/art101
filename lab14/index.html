                        <h2>Problems</h2>
                        <p>The problems we encountered during the lab was the CSS originally creating two borders around the results.
                            We found out that it was because of our previous CSS code, but when we changed it to a comment, it worked
                            and only created one border.
                        </p>

                <div class="results">
                        <h2>Results</h2>
                        <p>We created a button that says "Submit" with a user input box. We added an event listener and JS events, so
                           that when the user types in their name and click the button, it will take the length of their name and sort
                           them into a Hogwarts house. Within the function, there is a condition that sorts the user into one of the
                           four houses depending on the remainder of their name divided by 4.
