					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of the lab is to work with basic Javascript data types and variables.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>One problem we had was linking the Javascript to the HTML. The Javascript template had some code that interfered with linking to the Javascript and did not print the output in the HTML. We asked the TA for help, who told us to delete that part of the code.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>The assignment went well. The image and Javascript was able to be displayed in the HTML.</p>
