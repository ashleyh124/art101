                        <p>The challenge of the lab is to experiment with jQuery and AJAX.</p>

                        <h2>Problems</h2>
                        <p>The problems we encountered during the lab was getting the AJAX to successfully get information from an external source.
                            We orginally decided to use the Pokemon API, but since it had a lot of different information, we decided to go with an API
                            that was simpler (the Fortune Cookie API). We also had problems with putting the correct operators like commas and exclamation
                            marks in the right place in the code, but we were able to fix it.
                        </p>
                </div>
                <div class="results">
                        <h2>Results</h2>
                        <p>We created a button that says "Activate" in our HTML. We then used jQuery to add an event listener to the button and created a
                            function that calls on the AJAX to fetch the output from the Fortune Cookie API. If it is successful, the Javascript will return
                            a fortune but if it is unsuccessful, the console would say that there is an error. To be able to click on the button, the user
                            should have the Chrome extension "CORS Unblock" running on the website.
