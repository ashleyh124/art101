						<h2>Problems</h2>
						<p>The problems we encountered during the lab was we couldn't add an exclamation point to only the 
						number that is a multiple of 3, 5, and/or 7 at first. We tried to add an exclamation point to the 
						output code and that doesn't work, so we experimented with the code and referred to the lecture and 
						lab example. We realized we could use logic of checking the string is not equal to empty string and 
						add an exclamation point that way.
						</p>

				<div class="results">
						<h2>Results</h2>
						<p>We created a Fizzbuzz() function that loop through 1 to 200 and print the number 
						and a word if they are a multiple of 3, 5, and/or 7. It will print "Fizz" if it is a multiple of 3
						and "Buzz" if it is a multiple of 5. It will print "Boom" if it is a multiple of 7 and combine the 
						words into one string if it is a multiple of more than one condition.
