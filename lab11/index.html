                        <h2>Problems</h2>
                        <p>The problems we encountered during the lab was the CSS was not working but we realized we were using the wrong symbol for 
                        the id "output". We used a period instead of a hashtag but fixed it so that the CSS would work in the button section.
                        </p>

                <div class="results">
                        <h2>Results</h2>
                        <p>We created a button that says "Submit" with a user input box. We added an event listener and JS events, so that when the user 
                        type in their name and click the button, it will sort the name and randomize the letters positions to create a new name.
