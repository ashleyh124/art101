            <p>Hi! We are Ashley Hom and Wing Koon in section D. 
                We are both third year and cognitive science major. 
                We are interested in learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
                We took CSE 20 before but are still beginners in programming. 
                We look forward to building websites in this class.
            </p>
